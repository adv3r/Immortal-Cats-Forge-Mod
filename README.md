# Immortal Cats [Forge Mod]

This mod renders **all cats—tamed or feral—completely untouchable**. No damage. No red tint. No hurt sounds. No knockback. Your sword is but a suggestion to them.

Hit one? They meow. They spawn hearts. You look silly.

The cats do not fear you.

You live in _their_ apocalypse now.
